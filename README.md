My mathematics journey. Please enjoy!

## Questions:

A good mathematician can solve problems. A great mathematician can ask the right questions. I have always been told this in school. It makes sense. There are alot of questions in the world that can be observed mathematically in the world, but what is to gain if solved? I will brainstorm some questions that I find interesting in my day to day life. Questions that I will find the answer particularly interesting. Perhaps these questions have already been solved, but I will still present them.

### Word Match
A lot of analyst work with words. Although numbers are much easier to work with these words sometimes need to be searched with different databases (or sets). However words unlike numbers, words can't be matched so easily. For example, just the slightest letter can throw everything off. If you are trying to match the word "Thomas J" with "Thomas J." it most likely will not match. Of course we can go through the list of names and take away "." value to match, but we will still have the cases like matching "Thomas J" with "Thomas Joseph" or "J Thomas" with "Thomas J". There are many more difficulties that arise with this. So my questions is as follows:

    Is there a way to approximate that two words will match to some percentage given the information from each word in letters?

### Finding the Null Space
This next one is a problem that was presented in my accounting adventure. We were given a list of numbers and I needed to find the sums that added to 0. I call this finding the Null Space. However there are so many numbers that the basic algorithm of finding the number of combinations would be too slow. So the question is as follows:

    Is there an efficient way, given a list of numbers, to find the Null Space. (I.E. the maximum numbers that add to 0)?
